# VotingVoice

This is a prototype of a collaborative annotation tool for the VotingVoice project. This project is intended to support people with aphasia and reading, annotating, and reviewing complex documents. The core demo functionality is based on the OKFN Annotator project (http://annotatorjs.org/).

This work was supported by an award from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation's Accessible Voting Technology Initiative (http://elections.itif.org/).

A demo, with examples, may be found at http://voting.touchpadlab.com/guide
