		<h1>VotingVoice Project Demos</h1>
		<p>This page shows prototypes and demonstration videos for UMBC's VotingVoice project. The purpose of this project is to develop software tools to help people with aphasia (and possibly other reading-related or cognitive disabilities) to read content online, to take notes on that content, and to review it later.</p>
		<p>This page presents some initial prototypes of VotingVoice's features to solicit feedback from stakeholders. It should work in any modern web browser.</p>
		<p>Please view the demos below, and try out the interactive examples. At the bottom of the page, there is a link to a questionnaire where you can provide feedback on the current version. The entire process should take 15 minutes or less. Thanks for your help!</p>
		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p>There are 4 features currently in the prototype. Each is shown in detail below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Web page simplification.</strong> VotingVoice can remove distracting elements (ads, page headers) from web pages, leaving only the main page content.</li>
			<li><strong>Text to speech.</strong> Users can select any text in the document and have it read out loud.</li>
			<li><strong>Annotation.</strong> Users can take notes on the document and review them at any time. Notes can be made by the user or with help from someone else.</li>
			<li><strong>Note review.</strong> Users can review their notes in several different formats.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>Here are interactive examples of each of the features.</p>
		<h3>Web page simplification</h3>
		<p>VotingVoice uses a <a href="http://readability.com" target="_blank">text extraction algorithm</a> to find the main content in a web page and strip out extraneous content, leaving only the main article text and images. This is intended to make the page easier to read.</p>
		<p><img src="pages/gifs/readability-sidebyside-sm.png"/></p>
		<p>Examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://citypaper.com/news/election-101-1.1396307" target="_blank">Original page (City Paper 2012 voter guide)</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demos/election101.html" target="_blank">Simplified version of the above page</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-simplify.html" target="_blank">Text simplification demo (choose any web page)</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Text to speech</h3>
		<p>VotingVoice uses <a href="http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/" target="_blank">text-to-speech software</a> to read parts of a web page without any extra software. To use text to speech, select some text with the mouse and click on the speak button that pops up.</p>
		<p><img src="pages/gifs/speak.gif" border="1"/></p>
		<p>Example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-tts.html" target="_blank">Text to speech demo (MD 2012 ballot initiatives)</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Annotation</h3>
		<p>Users can add notes to pages using an <a href="http://annotateit.org" target="_blank">online annotation tool.</a> These notes are saved on the server, and can be retrieved at any time. To add a note, drag the text, and click the Annotate button. To read the note later, mouse over (or tap) the highlighted text.</p>
		<p>Notes can also include images. Just paste the complete address of the image into the notes field, and VotingVoice will store the image.</p>
		<p>Finally, notes can have icon-based tags attached to them. These tags can be added to any note by clicking the icon, and are shown when the note is reviewed.

		<p>Examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-tag-text.html" target="_blank">Demo: Add notes (text only)</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-tag-image.html" target="_blank">Demo: Add notes (with tags)</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-tag-readonly.html" target="_blank">Demo: Page with various kinds of notes</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Note review</h3>
		<p>Notes are saved on the server and can be reviewed at any time. There are several ways to review notes. Notes can be reviewed as pop-ups within the original page, printed out as a list, shown in the page margin, or viewed as a slideshow. </p>
		<p>Examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-static.html" target="_blank">Demo: Pop-up notes</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-list.html" target="_blank">Demo: Printable note list</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-margin.html" target="_blank">Demo: Notes in margin</a></li>
			<li><a href="pages/demo-slides.html" target="_blank">Demo: Note review slide show</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Feedback</h2>
		<p>Your feedback would be extremely helpful in determining the future direction of this work. We have prepared a short questionnaire about the prototype design, and would appreciate your feedback. It should take about 5 minutes to complete.</p>
